Tradition or Two Problems for the Study of Political Economy in a Colony

<footnote>I use the word us to speak to those who see a colonial past in the present.</footnote>

Reconceiving hermeneutical experience as an interplay between tradition and interpretation, Hans-Georg Gadamer writes, "The[hermeneutic] circle...is not formal in nature, it is neither subjective nor objective, but describes understanding as the interplay of the movement of tradition and the movement of the interpreter. The anticipation of meaning that governs our understanding of a text is not an act of subjectivity, but proceeds from the commonality that binds us to tradition. But this is condtained in our relation to tradition, in the constant process of education. Tradition is not simply a precondition into which we come, but we produce it ourselves, inasmuch as we understand, participate in the evolution of tradition and hence further determine it ourselves." (Truth and Method, 261). Gadamer effortlessly connects an understanding of a text with an immersion in a tradition which is related to the continuous process of educating oneself. This connection between tradition and education is hardly straightforward, neither is it easy to accept when one remembers the project of overhauling the university system in Colonial India, a project initiated by the British administration for different political ends. As far as the academy is concerned, our inability to invoke traditions of normative thought and claim making without speaking of an absence, an epistemic break, or rupture between the pre-modern and the modern is a political end of the British instated education that we continue to be burdened by. To speak of colonial education alone does not go far enough, for even the conceptual language we use to describe our experience and in the process produce it, is often governed by an ambivalence, a movement between the modern and the pre-modern. Such a movement can be generative in explaining a shift in the way we understand and respond to art, literature, and alternate practices of science, to take a few discursive examples. We become aware of this ambivalence when we recognize that colonial power shifted the way we cognize scientific knowledge, or what constitutes exemplary literature. Such a cognitive shift was induced by a falsificatory logic of colonial power (Kaviraj, "Sudden Death" 120). The power to falsify other ways of organizing social life was an imperative that the colonial administration undertook, but in the process also introduced modern techniques and discourses of organizing social life. Political economy is a discipline which stood at the forefront of this process. As a backward gaze from the contemporary to the moment where political economy arises in Colonial India, how do we conceive of a tradition when we engage with political economy as a discursive field? To counter and respond to Gadamer's concern through a colonial filter: can tradition be a ontological basis for an intellectual understanding of political economy? Can we move from the methodological to the ontological through tradition? Can tradition structure understanding when political economy as discourse and a set of institutions is a source of newness in Colonial India?

Gadamer invokes tradition to give hermeneutical experience---or the act of reading---a historicity: to convince us that the work of interpretation must be historically grounded Gadamer relies on a tradition of authors who thought deeply about aesthetics, hermeneutics and historical experience. Political economy with its concern with the circulation of value, and the ability of the laboring activity to transform social relationships, is hardly Gadamer's domain. Yet hermeneutics and political economy intersect when we see these intellectual activities as form of reading that seeks to give structure (or undo it). A form of reading that opens itself to a historicity (either to give voice to it or move beyond it). A form of reading which establishes a diachronic relationship between the contemporary, and the past, but differing in the object of analysis that they seek to transform. While hermenuetics in the Gadamerian sense can be reflexive, giving us a structure for the act of understanding and its historicity, political economy opens us to the social as an object of study, and the latter's historical complexities with the question of power. While Gadamer stresses the power of interpretation and reading, power in political economy, for us, has to begin with another reading of the colonial moment. If we take political economy as a discourse and an instrument of colonial control which reconfigured the social, at the heart of this  reconfiguration is the power weilded by a colonial administration to mark social difference, and concieve it as a variable that can be represented for an administrative apparatus to govern. If the social, or the way we conceive of society (gemeinschaft) is governed by a language which has been imposed or that comes from elsewhere, how do we enunciate a tradition of social thought when 19th century political economy remains silent on the question of colonialism? There is a play of absence and presence when we say that a modern configuration of the social as an object of study has its origins in 19th century British India: 1.) that the colonial administration constructed a particular configuration of the social (presence), and 2.) the search for a tradition that reflected on this change and sought to articulate its incongruencies in a language of its own (a possible absence). This play of absence and presence concerns the present, or the "now" from where I speak, however it does not get to the heart of my question, which is the meaning of the "politico-economic" when we think of political economy as having a colonial past. It is unclear to me was the "-economic" is doing vis-a-vis 19th century in Colonial India.  If we think of the colonial adminstration's reconfiguration of the social as a political project, then do we assume the establishment of modern economic relationships in the colony as a corollary to this political end? How do we think of the establishment of economic relationships within a colony?
