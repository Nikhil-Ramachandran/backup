When we place our intellectual gaze on economic institutions and ideas that were fundamental in configuring a colony into a hinterland which could be mined perpetually for its material resource, be this the development of capital markets, the evolution of the joint stock company, or the idea of political-economy itself, how do we trace the persistence and metamorphosis of capital formations to shape what we call social life? As an initial step towards this broad question, I would like to trace the evolution of political-economy as an idea and discursive field in Colonial India. More pointedly, I am interested in how political-economy as a field of study transmogrifies into "the economy" by the 1930s (Mitchell). Through such a move this most potent adjectival term "the political" is dislodged: what discursive and real effects necessitated colonial political-economy to evolve into "the economy"? How do we explain this erasure of the political and relegation of political-economy to a historicist artefact? By erasure of the political I point to a segregation of the political and the economic.
