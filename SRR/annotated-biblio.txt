Robert Brenner. "The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism." In The Brenner Debate.
In this essay social-property-systems are given the utmost agency in explaiining the economic evolution of class formations as a transition from  medieval to early modern England and France. Of particular interest is the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England; by the middle of 17th century and towards the turn of the 18th, Brenner suggests that there existed a substantial middle, and lower class "home-market" in England. Population continued to grow in England in the 18th century; "population continued to shift from agriculture to industry and from rural towards the urban areas, as there was a big growth not only of London, but also of Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham. Even so, grain prices ceased to rise. This allowed real wages to increase, and a new golden age for working people...the home market continued to grow...an upward spiral that extended into the Industrial Revolution" (327).

"Affixing the symbols of individual ownership by planting fences and hedges was...referred to by [British] colonists as "improvements." While in popular speech today improvement merely means to make something better, the word first signified fencing in large tracts of previously unenclosed land...the fence symbolized English ownership in a culturally powerful way...In the 17th and 18th centuries improvement also referred to two activities repeatedly carried out on the same land: grazing (domestic animals) and planting" (25)."Thus, when the English referred to their colonies in the New World as plantations, they were referring to themselves metaphorically as taking possession...it was a principle of natural law that "in vacant soyle, hee that taketh possession of it, and bestoweth culture and husbandry upon it, his Right it is [John Cotton, 1630]...planting the garden was an act of taking possession of the New World for England. It was not a law that entitled Englishmen to posses the New World, it was an <i>action</i> which established their rights" (29-31). Planting became an act that was to be understood by all as the beginning of settlement. Such an act was a cultural construct(38). Such a culturally loaded act could only be understood by the English legal code. 

Q.) how did the above understanding of planting change and influence 19th century legal poltics of claims on land, especially with the EIC? Quasi-sovereignty and Paramountacy.

Munn, Nancy D. 1992. The fame of Gawa: A symbolic study of value transformation in a Massim (Papua New Guinea) society. Durham, NC: Duke Univ. Press.:
The question of value formation and circulation at a distance in The Fame of Gawa has parallels with what Mintz calls "intimate interdependencies" along the commodity chain. At the outset, there is the parallel between the kula chain, and the commodity chain as forms of circulation. However, producer and consumer are never within line-of-sight in capitalist exchange, and of course, "value" is articulated in fundamentally different ways in the two systems of exchange just mentioned. Where as Gawans have to "face," "see," and even have  a "memory" of their near and distant food providers (to put it crudely). There is no such memory in capitalist exchange, apart from balance of payment accounts maintained and produced by state-spaces.[Such a sense of "memory" and interdependence is interfaced through the presence of a state-space.]
Mintz uses the word "intimacy" along with interdependence to reflect on the commodity chain. Though seemingly invisible, "intimate interdependence" links the fields of cultivation  (sugar cane fields) to  the space of the diniing table (commoditized sugar). How do we read this material transformation (from sugarcane to sugar) as a circulation and transformation of a sign (as with kula)? Can we think of a semiotic model for the transformative circulation of sugar, or in my case, tea? 

Arjun Appadurai. "Introduction: commodities and the politics of value." In The Social Life of Things. 
"Commodities represent very complex social forms and distribution of knowledge" (41). Very broadly, these can be classified as production knowledge on the one hand, and consumption knowledge on the other. In the case of tea production, bringing large areas of land under cultivation required technical expertise (however flawed), hence production knowledge. When tea is shipped to London for auctioneering, speculators have a different set of rules and information base on which they operate, hence consumption knowledge. Knowledge at both these poles are influenced by a distance in time, space, and institution. "As commodities travel greater distances [and across institutions]...knowledge about them tends to become partial, contradictory, and differentiated. But such differentiation [and contradiction] may itself...lead to the intensification of demand" (56).The key terms here for the circulation of tea and its value-transformation is institution. I am more interested a long history of how the value-transformation of commodities (tea) influences the use of land, and the meaning of land. [Mintz invokes the connection between "use" of a commodity, and its "meaning" as a semiotic frame for commodity.] The "moral economy" of food, and other commodities, will allow me to think about the commodification of, or extra-economic relationship to land. So, I have tea intensification on the one hand, and on the other, the commodification of land-- can both be thought of as different institutions? I continue to think through space (land) and its value-transformations under a colonial-state-space. Institutions create transformations and value-differentiations.The intenfiication of tea cultivation, and its relatioship to the value-transformaiton of land has to be thought of as a historiacl process which began in the colonial era.


Sweetness and Power
"the strange intimacies of preference formation": that in-between space that connects the histories of production to the histories of what becomes available for consumption; the historical intimacies that form our preferences today; transnationality of our present in everyday objects; (maya jasanoff article, the part about a smaller world. spatio-temporal contraction); summarize notes to intro;  briefly invoke the question of use, repitition, and meaning-->notmalization; how does such a form of repeated use erase a memory of colonial-slavery? in search of another way of making meaning-- here james scott would be useful; how would james scott respond to the habit of repeated consumption and its ability to create meaning; what would nancy munn say?

Seeing Like a State
Non-state-space, history and failure of intensification; rather than failure I am interested in how intensification persists. How does it move across different state-spaces as a form-of-knowledge (mitchell). In terms of its spatial effects, capital intensification cycles in the hinterland either leave us in ruins such a ghostly boom-towns(for agriculture what would be the equivalent?), or allows us to believe in a progressive/developmental future. Need to read the last chapters to understand the political implications of industrialized argicultural knowledge. I feel a lot goes back to the creation of state-space and its knowledge foundations, and also a politics can respond to such spatial and knowledge

<Non-Transnational Appraoches but with the potential to make pre-modern claims to land and identity: the books below, i think  tend to move towards a cultural apporach or "Moral economy of the peasant" type of analysis; identity and selfhood become important tools to counter a hegemonic discourse on soverignty etc; a question arises: can  non-transnational or cultural discourse give us another way to claim the present? they can if we are able to merge a transnational history (production-consumption and intimate-time-space-interdependencies, mintz) with a claim to the present. for this i need clear actors, who are the peopl i am invested in historicizing?
