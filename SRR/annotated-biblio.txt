  

During the 19th century, especially the latter half, a host of colonial political instruments and actors irrevocably changed the social fabric of the mountainscape of South India. This mountainous region called the Western Ghats saw a rapid increase in the land that was fenced for cultivation. What began as experiments in "gardening" eventually became full blown plantations. From the early 19th to the mid 20th century, cash crops were grown in the region. From coffee, to chinchona, to tea, and rubber, all found a place in different cycles growth and plantations re-entrenchment on the picturesque slopes of the Western Ghats.  At the outset I would like to trace the evolution of this process as a historical process  and political action that And within social fabric I include ecological relationships between human and extra-human natures (Moore). Deterritorialization and reterritorialization. 


1.) Robert Brenner. "The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism." In The Brenner Debate.In this essay social-property-systems are given the utmost agency in explaiining the economic evolution of class formations as a transition from  medieval to early modern England and France. Of particular interest is the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England; by the middle of 17th century and towards the turn of the 18th, Brenner suggests that there existed a substantial middle, and lower class "home-market" in England. Population continued to grow in England in the 18th century; "population continued to shift from agriculture to industry and from rural towards the urban areas, as there was a big growth not only of London, but also of Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham. Even so, grain prices ceased to rise. This allowed real wages to increase, and a new golden age for working people...the home market continued to grow...an upward spiral that extended into the Industrial Revolution" (327).

2.) Patricia Seed. Ceremonies of Possession in Europe's Conquest of the New World 1492-1640.: "Affixing the symbols of individual ownership by planting fences and hedges was...referred to by [British] colonists as "improvements." While in popular speech today improvement merely means to make something better, the word first signified fencing in large tracts of previously unenclosed land...the fence symbolized English ownership in a culturally powerful way...In the 17th and 18th centuries improvement also referred to two activities repeatedly carried out on the same land: grazing (domestic animals) and planting" (25)."Thus, when the English referred to their colonies in the New World as plantations, they were referring to themselves metaphorically as taking possession...it was a principle of natural law that "in vacant soyle, hee that taketh possession of it, and bestoweth culture and husbandry upon it, his Right it is [John Cotton, 1630]...planting the garden was an act of taking possession of the New World for England. It was not a law that entitled Englishmen to posses the New World, it was an <i>action</i> which established their rights" (29-31). Planting became an act that was to be understood by all as the beginning of settlement. Such an act was a cultural construct(38). Such a culturally loaded act could only be understood by the English legal code. Q.) how did the above understanding of planting change and influence 19th century legal poltics of claims on land, especially with the EIC?  Quasi-sovereignty and Paramountacy.

3.)Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker. The Many Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic. Boston: Beacon Press, 2000."Labors of expropriation included the clear-cutting of woods, the draining of marshes, the reclamation of fens, and the hedging of the arable field---in sum, the obliteration of the commoning habitus. Woodlands contained flourishing economies of forest people in England...their destruction was the first step toward agrarian "civilization"...[1640] the "Act for the Limitation of Forests...was the signal for the beginning of widespread destruction of forests." In the year 1649 the Parliamentary Committee for the Preservation of Timber was formed to check the depredations of the "looser and disordered sort of people" who continued to insist upon their common rights in the forests" (43). Linebaugh and Redikar powerfully explicate the question of the commons. A parallel situation is observed in the forests of South West India where animal, plant and human life are displaced simultaneously as the commons. A question that arises here is, how do we write a history which is at once a critique of ecological and human displacement, which at once pays close heed to the transformation of nature-in-space, as well as humans-in-space. Is there a genealogical way of writing a history of the commons by looking at finished commodities but tracing backward from today the histories of displacement that were simulataneously being created as we move through cycles of production and consumption? It is not enough that we write histories of production and consumption, but rather the displacements that undergird such cycles as well. 


4.)A Search for Sovereignty: Law and Geography in European Empires 1400-1900. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. "Quasi sovereign states [such as those under paramountacy, as in the case of Travancore in South West Colonial India] came to be  imagined everywhere [within the British Empire in the 19th century] as anamolous legal spaces, where the application of imperial law defied easy categorization and seemed even to require the occasional suspension of law" (227)."The same Foreign Office officials who prided themselves on systematizing legal relatiosn between the native states also developed and refined the notion that paramountacy resided mainly in the prerogative of the imperial power to decide where law ended and politics began. More precisely, the colonial state claimed the power not to decide -- to remain silent on questions that were "beyond the power of language" (260). When it came to bringing hill regions within legal purview (as in the case of land acquired to cultivate tea in Travancore) an extra-legal process whereby "holes and silences" in the legal system were created which came to define what was called  a "territorial enclave" (270). This legal term was at once a geographic marker and a sign which meant that standard legal parameters of governance do not apply. As Benton shows, "territoral enclave" was often used to demarcate a region that was hilly, and at the same time anamolous in that it created "holes" and "silences" within the legal system through is "legal primitiveness". Since such regions did not conform to British legal ideas of autonomy and legitamacy, In dealing with the Bhils, a hill tribe that lived on the border of Baroda (princely state) and Kandesh (a British district), it was suggested that "the introduction of laws and regulations seems likely to lead to...difficulty. The British Government of India are disposed to think that , for a backward community like the Dang Bhils, the strongest and most effective form of control is the personal rule of a British officer untrammeled by anything but executive orders from his own Government" (Benton citing a colonial legal manual, 264). 
5.) Manu Goswami, Producing India:"Lefebvre locates abstract spacet-time in the "capitalist trinity," that is, the production and circulation of land (rent), labor (Wages), and capital (profits) and the generalization of form-determined capitalist sociql relations.." (35). "The mercantilist regime of the East India Company was grounded on the extraction of tribute...In contrast, the post 1857 colonial regime hinged on "occupying space, producing space"...a new colonial state form" (45). "The self-understanding of the colonial state as the supreme landlord, continually reiterated within offical discourse, coexisted with the intensified commodification of space, the extension of the regime of private property, and a phenomenal increase in rural indebtedness in the first half of the nineteenth century...[The colonial state's appropriation of an ultimate right of ownership of land] was rendered socially effective in the enduring practice of "hypothecation," whereby the state reserved a supremem claim to land by selling land deeds at public auction in the event of a failure to pay the cash revenues on time" (55). "In a process that mirrored the acquisition of land for railway construction, a simple gazette notification stating that forest and wasterlands were reserved as "state forests" effectively erased all...customary rights. Because claims on forest and wastelands had to be grounded in legal records of ownership, the vast majority of nonliterate subaltern communities were simply dispossed of their lands" (58). This last line assumes that state-ownership of forest land was an assumed mandate. How would this situation change in the case of a princely state, I can understand this being the case for a Presidency as in the case of Bombay, Madras, or Bengal. However in the case of a smaller princely state where indirect rule was being practiced, how do we trace state-ownership of land.

6.) Seeing Like a State:Non-state-space, history and failure of intensification; rather than failure I am interested in how intensification persists. How does it move across different state-spaces as a form-of-knowledge (mitchell). In terms of its spatial effects, capital intensification cycles in the hinterland either leave us in ruins such a ghostly boom-towns(for agriculture what would be the equivalent?), or allows us to believe in a progressive/developmental future. Need to read the last chapters to understand the political implications of industrialized argicultural knowledge. I feel a lot goes back to the creation of state-space and its knowledge foundations, and also a politics can respond to such spatial and knowledge

8.) Shorelines: Space and Rights in South India. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009. "[After the revolt of 1857,] the new policy [of Direct Crown rule and noninterference in religious matters of the princely states]" upheld the soverignty of these states, "as a necessary buffer against the rising tide of rebellion against empire. It underwrote the territorial sovereignty of the princes in exchange for their loyalty" (76). Within a decade of this move the colonial state compelled the princes "to assume more responsibility to their subjects amd demonstrate their achievements" through "good governance" (77). This however meant large scale economic development. But the curiosity fact of the matter is that economic development was always articulate in the idiom of a moral improvement as well. "Through the large scale investment of private foreign capital in coffee, tea, and rubber plantations and in coir and coconut oil agroprocessing industries, Travancore was gradually integrated into an international commodity market dominated by European capital. European firms predominated, exerting near total control over commerciala nd financial activity. By the late nineteenth century Travancore econoy was "an essentially export oriented agro-based industrial complex characterized by the overall predominance of foreign capital...In 1865, the Travancore Dewan...granted full ownership rights to peasant cultivators of...government lands. He also allowed the unrestricted transfer of landed property, soon follwed by reforms ensuring tenants of private landlands legal protection and permanent occupancy rights. The commodification of land..."

10.) Munn, Nancy D. 1992. The fame of Gawa: A symbolic study of value transformation in a Massim (Papua New Guinea) society. Durham, NC: Duke Univ. Press.: The question of value formation and circulation at a distance in The Fame of Gawa has parallels with what Mintz calls "intimate interdependencies" along the commodity chain. At the outset, there is the parallel between the kula chain, and the commodity chain as forms of circulation. However, producer and consumer are never within line-of-sight in capitalist exchange, and of course, "value" is articulated in fundamentally different ways in the two systems of exchange just mentioned. Where as Gawans have to "face," "see," and even have  a "memory" of their near and distant food providers (to put it crudely). There is no such memory in capitalist exchange, apart from balance of payment accounts maintained and produced by state-spaces.[Such a sense of "memory" and interdependence is interfaced through the presence of a state-space.]
Mintz uses the word "intimacy" along with interdependence to reflect on the commodity chain. Though seemingly invisible, "intimate interdependence" links the fields of cultivation  (sugar cane fields) to  the space of the diniing table (commoditized sugar). How do we read this material transformation (from sugarcane to sugar) as a circulation and transformation of a sign (as with kula)? Can we think of a semiotic model for the transformative circulation of sugar, or in my case, tea?

11.) Arjun Appadurai. "Introduction: commodities and the politics of value." In The Social Life of Things.:"Commodities represent very complex social forms and distribution of knowledge" (41). Very broadly, these can be classified as production knowledge on the one hand, and consumption knowledge on the other. In the case of tea production, bringing large areas of land under cultivation required technical expertise (however flawed), hence production knowledge. When tea is shipped to London for auctioneering, speculators have a different set of rules and information base on which they operate, hence consumption knowledge. Knowledge at both these poles are influenced by a distance in time, space, and institution. "As commodities travel greater distances [and across institutions]...knowledge about them tends to become partial, contradictory, and differentiated. But such differentiation [and contradiction] may itself...lead to the intensification of demand" (56).The key terms here for the circulation of tea and its value-transformation is institution. I am more interested a long history of how the value-transformation of commodities (tea) influences the use of land, and the meaning of land. [Mintz invokes the connection between "use" of a commodity, and its "meaning" as a semiotic frame for commodity.] The "moral economy" of food, and other commodities, will allow me to think about the commodification of, or extra-economic relationship to land. So, I have tea intensification on the one hand, and on the other, the commodification of land-- can both be thought of as different institutions? I continue to think through space (land) and its value-transformations under a colonial-state-space. Institutions create transformations and value-differentiations.The intenfiication of tea cultivation, and its relatioship to the value-transformaiton of land has to be thought of as a historiacl process which began in the colonial era.

Isolation, and lateness of labor and political consciousness.
Focus on production;
There's a part of Baak's writing which gives the impression that life on a tea plantation high amongst the clouds was deeply isolating, especially in the later half of the 19th century when tea was being planted as a subsitute for the coffee fields which had withered from pestilence between 1860-1880. This sense of being isolated from the  "plains" develops and transforms in Baak's writing as a  political aloofness of the region from the early 20th century nationalist movement, as well as the labor conscioussness that was rising at the time. In Baak's historical plot, labor conscioussness develops in the 1930s and becomes a political question with the Communist Party of India establishing a strong foothold after 1947.
Baak, as the title of the book suggest, focuses solely on the production side. Consumption, as well as  of where and how tea is transported to different destinationsne has to think about demand (Mintz), and also of cultivating a taste (Bordieu). How do we retell this story from a maritime and hence transnational perspective of how plantations were formed? Through such a process, how do we question the presence of the plantation as a "given" or assumed form of life. Include ships, sailors, hewers of land, coolies; Baak focuses on the struggles of planter's who were midlevel managers without access to land, especially their historical evolution as eventual plantation holders. This would allow us to this about the property-system, and speculate on the conditions of labor more indirectly; Baak describes 1850-1900 as the period of the planter's Raj in south west india, its a period where large tracts of land are acquired by foreign planters (as opposed to native planters); its a period when coffee plantations wither through disease. Tea is planted in the region; describe the political conditions under which "jungle land" was usurped on a large scale; why do we get a picture as though the plantations were insulated from the larger labour and nationalist movement? paramountacy is given a detailed description. Not enough is said on the conditions that created property rights or claium on the land; the plantations a prison, a space from where escape seems unfathomable, or at the risk of being caught all too easily;

15.) P. Sanal Mohan, Modernity of Slavery: Struggles against Caste Inequality in Colonial Kerala: "In precolonial Travancore, land was held as the possession of the state as well as the property of big landlord families and temples. With the Pandarappattom proclamation of 1865, there emerged a middle-stratum peasantry that was drawn mainly from upper castes, including a substantial number of Ezhavas...This new proclamation bestowed ownership rights on the tenants that were qualified as 'heritable salelable and otherwise transferable, subject only to the obligation of paying the land tax assessed to them'...The ownership of land was, in the process, diffused among all castes and groups connected with agriculture...But these changes were to have only marginal effect on the untouchable slave castes of Travancore...The slave castes, particularly the Pulayas, Parayas, and Kuravas, were reduced to agrestic slavery that had a long history in Travancore" (17). My interest is not so much in the conditions of slavery, but rather the attempt at creating tradeable land as private property. The caste question enters the fray for me through the land question. The landless caste slave, rather than caste slave alone is crucial for my purposes. In short, Mohan asserts that capitalist production did not really create new social relationships, but gave the older caste structure a new mold-- that of slavery. If caste-slavery persisted desipte a transition toward capitalist production, in a sense, would this in any way make wage-labor an ineffective sign to mobilize under? I ask because if we think of a developing public sphere in Travancore during the late 19th and early 20th century, several communities were forming public identities by organizing themselves into different political organs that represented them. More than labor, public identities were being created through religious and caste affiliations (Baak). However as with the Syrian Christians, such public identities were able to consolidate land-holdings and even develop themsevles as planters (22).   
"The colonial transformation of slave castes in Kerala was characterized by experiences such as the transition from slave labor to various intermediary stage of wage labor. This happened with the continuous dominance of the caste structure that mediated the process of the formation of a working class, which was a complex phenomenon in itself. The new subjectivity of slave castes that was shaped by the project of colonial modernity contained strands of missionary Christianity, modern education, and the ideas and practices of social reform. The agency of slave castes in the context of the new institutional sites under colonialism negotiated for new social space" (26). As far as political economy is concerned, such a space is deeply intertwined between caste, religion, and class. On the one hand you have Ezhavas (low-castes) becoming land-holders, while Pulayas (low-castes) remaing as wage-laborers, or more so the unorganized. Pulayas were also converted from low-castes to Christianity.

20.) Griffiths, Percival. The History of the Indian Tea Industry. (London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 1967).From the perspective of the tea industry organizations, as well as the colonial state, gives a historical account of the problems of recruitment in labour. Also gives detailed account of Tea propaganda that was under discussion in the 1880s when a consortium of tea planters were trying to re-established tea as a popular drink in America. Such a propaganda parallels the intensification of tea production; Percival describes this period "Tea Mania and Collapse". The labour problems corroborate the implimentation of harsh or extrememly punishing labor laws that were enacted in late 19th century. "Tea Mania"--- a rapid expansion of land under tea cultivation;  "Tea Propaganda"--- expansion of tea market into American; and harsh labor laws form three parallel processes during the late 19th century. If we place our gaze on the operation of the tea companies it becomes easier to think about different scales of operation, where-in we can have a global scale at the level of world market, this happens only once tea auctioneering and hence tea price is consolidated at the global level. Like wise tea companies were also operating at the regional level when they had to negotiate with the dewan of a princely state, who was basically the intermediary between the King and the British officials as part of the indirect rule. At the local level tea companies had to deal with the question of land and labor, where land problems could be anywhere between acquiring more space, or negotiating taxation. However this method would focus far too much on the operations of the tea companies, land and labor only function to establish the prerogatives of the tea industry. What would be far more fulfilling is if land and labor can be instilled with enough agency to form a critique from the perspective of the dispossed. Focussing on caste-slavery with missionary linkages could solve some of this problem, however land again would be left impotent. I say impotent because I am aware that when the communist government comes into place in 1956, one of its rallying cries which allows it to come to power is "land to the tiller." Large-scale land reform was implemented, but I am not sure if plantationa acrege was reduced. If not, then the land question once again is hardly potent against the presence of the tea plantations. Instead another way to re-open the land question could be to focus on pests that created loss of crop. This is because when large acres of land are cultivated with the same crop, it is more susceptible to swarms of pest. Another problem that the tea companies would have to face as markets expanded was the maintenance of a quality of product. This is where technology comes into play, and well as the need to raise money to build a tea processing plant.  

21.) Mateer, Native Life in Travancore. (Madras: Asian Educational Services, 1991). Prior to forest land being usurped for tea cultivation, nomadic hill tribes inhabited the area. They practiced a form of slash-and-burn cultivation within the confines of the forest. They had their own rituals for cultivation as well as marriage-- an idiosyncratic way of life (68). Mateer who worked as a colonial civil servant who also adjudicated greviances on plantations, gives an intimate description of Kanikars. Etymologically, kanikaran refers to "hereditary proprietor of land." What could such a sense of land have meant? Mateer does not ask such questions, he documents the kinship customs, relationship with their cheiftan, agricultural practices, and interactions with planters as the latter encroahced their land. I am curious if the Kanikars ever appealed the law when their land was grabbed from them.
