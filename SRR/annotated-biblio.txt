the ics officer(expert) who wrote the book i am reading on colonial tea:

Seeing Like a State
Non-state-space, history and failure of intensification; rather than failure I am interested in how intensification persists. How does it move across different state-spaces as a form-of-knowledge (mitchell). In terms of its spatial effects, capital intensification cycles in the hinterland either leave us in ruins such a ghostly boom-towns(for agriculture what would be the equivalent?), or allows us to believe in a progressive/developmental future. Need to read the last chapters to understand the political implications of industrialized argicultural knowledge. I feel a lot goes back to the creation of state-space and its knowledge foundations, and also a politics can respond to such spatial and knowledge claim.

Sweetness and Power
"the strange intimacies of preference formation": that in-between space that connects the histories of production to the histories of what becomes available for consumption; the historical intimacies that form our preferences today; transnationality of our present in everyday objects; (maya jasanoff article, the part about a smaller world. spatio-temporal contraction); summarize notes to intro;  briefly invoke the question of use, repitition, and meaning-->notmalization; how does such a form of repeated use erase a memory of colonial-slavery? in search of another way of making meaning-- here james scott would be useful; how would james scott respond to the habit of repeated consumption and its ability to create meaning; what would nancy munn say? 

Capitalism in the Web of Life

Reassembling the Social


<Non-Transnational Appraoches but with the potential to make pre-modern claims to land and identity: the books below, i think  tend to move towards a cultural apporach or "Moral economy of the peasant" type of analysis; identity and selfhood become important tools to counter a hegemonic discourse on soverignty etc; a question arises: can  non-transnational or cultural discourse give us another way to claim the present? they can if we are able to merge a transnational history (production-consumption and intimate-time-space-interdependencies, mintz) with a claim to the present. for this i need clear actors, who are the peopl i am invested in historicizing?
