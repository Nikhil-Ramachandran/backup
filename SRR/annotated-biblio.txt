  

During the 19th century, especially the latter half, a host of colonial political instruments and actors irrevocably changed the social fabric of the mountainscape of South India. This mountainous region called the Western Ghats saw a rapid increase in the land that was fenced for cultivation. What began as experiments in "gardening" eventually became full blown plantations. From the early 19th to the mid 20th century, cash crops were grown in the region. From coffee, to chinchona, to tea, and rubber, all found a place in different cycles growth and plantations re-entrenchment on the picturesque slopes of the Western Ghats.  At the outset I would like to trace the evolution of this process as a historical process  and political action that And within social fabric I include ecological relationships between human and extra-human natures (Moore).

1.) Robert Brenner. "The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism." In The Brenner Debate.In this essay social-property-systems are given the utmost agency in explaiining the economic evolution of class formations as a transition from  medieval to early modern England and France. Of particular interest is the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England; by the middle of 17th century and towards the turn of the 18th, Brenner suggests that there existed a substantial middle, and lower class "home-market" in England. Population continued to grow in England in the 18th century; "population continued to shift from agriculture to industry and from rural towards the urban areas, as there was a big growth not only of London, but also of Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham. Even so, grain prices ceased to rise. This allowed real wages to increase, and a new golden age for working people...the home market continued to grow...an upward spiral that extended into the Industrial Revolution" (327).

2.) Patricia Seed. Ceremonies of Possession in Europe's Conquest of the New World 1492-1640.: "Affixing the symbols of individual ownership by planting fences and hedges was...referred to by [British] colonists as "improvements." While in popular speech today improvement merely means to make something better, the word first signified fencing in large tracts of previously unenclosed land...the fence symbolized English ownership in a culturally powerful way...In the 17th and 18th centuries improvement also referred to two activities repeatedly carried out on the same land: grazing (domestic animals) and planting" (25)."Thus, when the English referred to their colonies in the New World as plantations, they were referring to themselves metaphorically as taking possession...it was a principle of natural law that "in vacant soyle, hee that taketh possession of it, and bestoweth culture and husbandry upon it, his Right it is [John Cotton, 1630]...planting the garden was an act of taking possession of the New World for England. It was not a law that entitled Englishmen to posses the New World, it was an <i>action</i> which established their rights" (29-31). Planting became an act that was to be understood by all as the beginning of settlement. Such an act was a cultural construct(38). Such a culturally loaded act could only be understood by the English legal code. Q.) how did the above understanding of planting change and influence 19th century legal poltics of claims on land, especially with the EIC?  Quasi-sovereignty and Paramountacy.

5.) Manu Goswami, Producing India:"Lefebvre locates abstract spacet-time in the "capitalist trinity," that is, the production and circulation of land (rent), labor (Wages), and capital (profits) and the generalization of form-determined capitalist sociql relations.." (35). "The mercantilist regime of the East India Company was grounded on the extraction of tribute...In contrast, the post 1857 colonial regime hinged on "occupying space, producing space"...a new colonial state form" (45). "The self-understanding of the colonial state as the supreme landlord, continually reiterated within offical discourse, coexisted with the intensified commodification of space, the extension of the regime of private property, and a phenomenal increase in rural indebtedness in the first half of the nineteenth century...[The colonial state's appropriation of an ultimate right of ownership of land] was rendered socially effective in the enduring practice of "hypothecation," whereby the state reserved a supremem claim to land by selling land deeds at public auction in the event of a failure to pay the cash revenues on time" (55). "In a process that mirrored the acquisition of land for railway construction, a simple gazette notification stating that forest and wasterlands were reserved as "state forests" effectively erased all...customary rights. Because claims on forest and wastelands had to be grounded in legal records of ownership, the vast majority of nonliterate subaltern communities were simply dispossed of their lands" (58). This last line assumes that state-ownership of forest land was an assumed mandate. How would this situation change in the case of a princely state, I can understand this being the case for a Presidency as in the case of Bombay, Madras, or Bengal. However in the case of a smaller princely state where indirect rule was being practiced, how do we trace state-ownership of land.

6.) Seeing Like a State:Non-state-space, history and failure of intensification; rather than failure I am interested in how intensification persists. How does it move across different state-spaces as a form-of-knowledge (mitchell). In terms of its spatial effects, capital intensification cycles in the hinterland either leave us in ruins such a ghostly boom-towns(for agriculture what would be the equivalent?), or allows us to believe in a progressive/developmental future. Need to read the last chapters to understand the political implications of industrialized argicultural knowledge. I feel a lot goes back to the creation of state-space and its knowledge foundations, and also a politics can respond to such spatial and knowledge

8.) Shorelines: Space and Rights in South India. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009. "[After the revolt of 1857,] the new policy [of Direct Crown rule and noninterference in religious matters of the princely states]" upheld the soverignty of these states, "as a necessary buffer against the rising tide of rebellion against empire. It underwrote the territorial sovereignty of the princes in exchange for their loyalty" (76). Within a decade of this move the colonial state compelled the princes "to assume more responsibility to their subjects amd demonstrate their achievements" through "good governance" (77). This however meant large scale economic development. But the curiosity fact of the matter is that economic development was always articulate in the idiom of a moral improvement as well. "Through the large scale investment of private foreign capital in coffee, tea, and rubber plantations and in coir and coconut oil agroprocessing industries, Travancore was gradually integrated into an international commodity market dominated by European capital. European firms predominated, exerting near total control over commerciala nd financial activity. By the late nineteenth century Travancore econoy was "an essentially export oriented agro-based industrial complex characterized by the overall predominance of foreign capital...In 1865, the Travancore Dewan...granted full ownership rights to peasant cultivators of...government lands. He also allowed the unrestricted transfer of landed property, soon follwed by reforms ensuring tenants of private landlands legal protection and permanent occupancy rights. The commodification of land..."

10.) Munn, Nancy D. 1992. The fame of Gawa: A symbolic study of value transformation in a Massim (Papua New Guinea) society. Durham, NC: Duke Univ. Press.:
The question of value formation and circulation at a distance in The Fame of Gawa has parallels with what Mintz calls "intimate interdependencies" along the commodity chain. At the outset, there is the parallel between the kula chain, and the commodity chain as forms of circulation. However, producer and consumer are never within line-of-sight in capitalist exchange, and of course, "value" is articulated in fundamentally different ways in the two systems of exchange just mentioned. Where as Gawans have to "face," "see," and even have  a "memory" of their near and distant food providers (to put it crudely). There is no such memory in capitalist exchange, apart from balance of payment accounts maintained and produced by state-spaces.[Such a sense of "memory" and interdependence is interfaced through the presence of a state-space.]
Mintz uses the word "intimacy" along with interdependence to reflect on the commodity chain. Though seemingly invisible, "intimate interdependence" links the fields of cultivation  (sugar cane fields) to  the space of the diniing table (commoditized sugar). How do we read this material transformation (from sugarcane to sugar) as a circulation and transformation of a sign (as with kula)? Can we think of a semiotic model for the transformative circulation of sugar, or in my case, tea?

11.) Arjun Appadurai. "Introduction: commodities and the politics of value." In The Social Life of Things.:"Commodities represent very complex social forms and distribution of knowledge" (41). Very broadly, these can be classified as production knowledge on the one hand, and consumption knowledge on the other. In the case of tea production, bringing large areas of land under cultivation required technical expertise (however flawed), hence production knowledge. When tea is shipped to London for auctioneering, speculators have a different set of rules and information base on which they operate, hence consumption knowledge. Knowledge at both these poles are influenced by a distance in time, space, and institution. "As commodities travel greater distances [and across institutions]...knowledge about them tends to become partial, contradictory, and differentiated. But such differentiation [and contradiction] may itself...lead to the intensification of demand" (56).The key terms here for the circulation of tea and its value-transformation is institution. I am more interested a long history of how the value-transformation of commodities (tea) influences the use of land, and the meaning of land. [Mintz invokes the connection between "use" of a commodity, and its "meaning" as a semiotic frame for commodity.] The "moral economy" of food, and other commodities, will allow me to think about the commodification of, or extra-economic relationship to land. So, I have tea intensification on the one hand, and on the other, the commodification of land-- can both be thought of as different institutions? I continue to think through space (land) and its value-transformations under a colonial-state-space. Institutions create transformations and value-differentiations.The intenfiication of tea cultivation, and its relatioship to the value-transformaiton of land has to be thought of as a historiacl process which began in the colonial era.

Isolation, and lateness of labor and political consciousness.
Focus on production;
There's a part of Baak's writing which gives the impression that life on a tea plantation high amongst the clouds was deeply isolating, especially in the later half of the 19th century when tea was being planted as a subsitute for the coffee fields which had withered from pestilence between 1860-1880. This sense of being isolated from the  "plains" develops and transforms in Baak's writing as a  political aloofness of the region from the early 20th century nationalist movement, as well as the labor conscioussness that was rising at the time. In Baak's historical plot, labor conscioussness develops in the 1930s and becomes a political question with the Communist Party of India establishing a strong foothold after 1947.
Baak, as the title of the book suggest, focuses solely on the production side. Consumption, as well as  of where and how tea is transported to different destinationsne has to think about demand (Mintz), and also of cultivating a taste (Bordieu). How do we retell this story from a maritime and hence transnational perspective of how plantations were formed? Through such a process, how do we question the presence of the plantation as a "given" or assumed form of life. Include ships, sailors, hewers of land, coolies; Baak focuses on the struggles of planter's who were midlevel managers without access to land, especially their historical evolution as eventual plantation holders. This would allow us to this about the property-system, and speculate on the conditions of labor more indirectly; Baak describes 1850-1900 as the period of the planter's Raj in south west india, its a period where large tracts of land are acquired by foreign planters (as opposed to native planters); its a period when coffee plantations wither through disease. Tea is planted in the region; describe the political conditions under which "jungle land" was usurped on a large scale; why do we get a picture as though the plantations were insulated from the larger labour and nationalist movement? paramountacy is given a detailed description. Not enough is said on the conditions that created property rights or claium on the land; the plantations a prison, a space from where escape seems unfathomable, or at the risk of being caught all too easily;

<Non-Transnational Appraoches but with the potential to make pre-modern claims to land and identity: the books below, i think  tend to move towards a cultural apporach or "Moral economy of the peasant" type of analysis; identity and selfhood become important tools to counter a hegemonic discourse on soverignty etc; a question arises: can  non-transnational or cultural discourse give us another way to claim the present? they can if we are able to merge a transnational history (production-consumption and intimate-time-space-interdependencies, mintz) with a claim to the present. for this i need clear actors, who are the peopl i am invested in historicizing?
