Munn, Nancy D. 1992. The fame of Gawa: A symbolic study of value transformation in a Massim (Papua New Guinea) society. Durham, NC: Duke Univ. Press.:
The question of value formation and circulation at a distance in The Fame of Gawa has parallels with what Mintz calls "intimate interdependencies" along the commodity chain. At the outset, there is the parallel between the kula chain, and the commodity chain as forms of circulation. However, producer and consumer are never within line-of-sight in capitalist exchange, and of course, "value" is articulated in fundamentally different ways in the two systems of exchange just mentioned. Where as Gawans have to "face," "see," and even have  a "memory" of their near and distant food providers (to put it crudely). There is no such memory in capitalist exchange, apart from balance of payment accounts maintained and produced by state-spaces.[Such a sense of "memory" and interdependence is interfaced through the presence of a state-space.]
Mintz uses the word "intimacy" along with interdependence to reflect on the commodity chain. Though seemingly invisible, "intimate interdependence" links the fields of cultivation  (sugar cane fields) to  the space of the diniing table (commoditized sugar). How do we read this material transformation (from sugarcane to sugar) as a circulation and transformation of a sign (as with kula)? Can we think of a semiotic model for the transformative circulation of sugar, or in my case, tea? 

The Social Life of Things--Arjun Appadurai: "Commodities represent very complex social forms and distribution of knowledge" (41). Very broadly, these can be classified as  production knowledge on the one hand, and consumption knowledge on the other. In the case of tea production, bringing large areas of land under cultivation required  technical expertise (however flawed), hence production knowledge. When tea is shipped to London for auctioneering, speculators have a different set of rules and information base on which they operate, hence consumption knowledge. Knowledge at both these poles are influenced by a distance in time, space, and institution. "As commodities travel greater distances [and across institutions]...knowledge about them tends to become partial, contradictory, and differentiated. But such differentiation [and contradiction] may itself...lead to the intensification of demand" (56).The key terms here for the circulation of tea and its value-transformation is institution. I am more interested in how value of a commodity (tea) influences the use of land, and the meaning of land. [Mintz invokes the connection be "use" of a commodity, and its "meaning" in a semiotics of the commodity.] The "moral economy" of food, and other commodities, will allow me to think about the commodification of land. So I have tea intensification on the one hand, and on the other, the commodification of land. with this i continue to think about the question between space and value, of course, this has become easier by invoking the question of institutions and how they create value-differentiations. This is a historiacl process.

Seeing Like a State
Non-state-space, history and failure of intensification; rather than failure I am interested in how intensification persists. How does it move across different state-spaces as a form-of-knowledge (mitchell). In terms of its spatial effects, capital intensification cycles in the hinterland either leave us in ruins such a ghostly boom-towns(for agriculture what would be the equivalent?), or allows us to believe in a progressive/developmental future. Need to read the last chapters to understand the political implications of industrialized argicultural knowledge. I feel a lot goes back to the creation of state-space and its knowledge foundations, and also a politics can respond to such spatial and knowledge claim.

Sweetness and Power
"the strange intimacies of preference formation": that in-between space that connects the histories of production to the histories of what becomes available for consumption; the historical intimacies that form our preferences today; transnationality of our present in everyday objects; (maya jasanoff article, the part about a smaller world. spatio-temporal contraction); summarize notes to intro;  briefly invoke the question of use, repitition, and meaning-->notmalization; how does such a form of repeated use erase a memory of colonial-slavery? in search of another way of making meaning-- here james scott would be useful; how would james scott respond to the habit of repeated consumption and its ability to create meaning; what would nancy munn say?

Reassembling the Social

---------------------------------
<Non-Transnational Appraoches but with the potential to make pre-modern claims to land and identity: the books below, i think  tend to move towards a cultural apporach or "Moral economy of the peasant" type of analysis; identity and selfhood become important tools to counter a hegemonic discourse on soverignty etc; a question arises: can  non-transnational or cultural discourse give us another way to claim the present? they can if we are able to merge a transnational history (production-consumption and intimate-time-space-interdependencies, mintz) with a claim to the present. for this i need clear actors, who are the peopl i am invested in historicizing?
