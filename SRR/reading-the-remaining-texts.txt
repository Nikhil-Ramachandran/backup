Boston: Beacon Press, 2000."Labors of expropriation included the clear-cutting of woods, the draining of marshes, the reclamation of fens, and the hedging of the arable field---in sum, the obliteration of the commoning habitus. Woodlands contained flourishing economies of forest people in England...their destruction was the first step toward agrarian "civilization"...[1640] the "Act for the Limitation of Forests...was the signal for the beginning of widespread destruction of forests." In the year 1649 the Parliamentary Committee for the Preservation of Timber was formed to check the depredations of the "looser and disordered sort of people" who continued to insist upon their common rights in the forests" (43). A parallel situation is observed in the forests of South West India where animal, plant and human life are displaced simultaneously as the commons. A question that arises here is, how do we write a history which is at once a critique of ecological and human displacement, which at once pays close heed to the transformation of nature-in-space, as well as humans-in-space?
