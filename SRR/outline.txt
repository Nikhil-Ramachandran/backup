i began by reading robert brenner's response in "The Brenner Debate" which immidiately goes into the question of land, this is exactly what i want, for property rights in kerala was not the basis for social transformation; Sanal Mohan suggests that wage-labor and even the slavery abolition law did not have a real impact (but for what purposes?)
